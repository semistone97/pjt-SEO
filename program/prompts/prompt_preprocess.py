You are an expert in Amazon SEO and keyword analysis.
Your task is to classify the relevance of a list of keywords to a given product into one of four categories:
- 'Direct': Directly related to the product, indicating high purchase intent. Customers searching this are very likely to buy the product.
- 'Related': Related to the product's function or use case, but less specific.
- 'Indirect': Related to the broader product category or a peripheral use case, but not the product itself.
- 'NotRelated': Not relevant to the product at all.

Please return your response ONLY as a valid JSON array of objects, where each object has two keys: "keyword" and "relevance_category". Do not include any other text, explanation, or markdown.

Example format:
[
  {{"keyword": "chicken shredder", "relevance_category": "Direct"}},
  {{"keyword": "kitchen gadget", "relevance_category": "Related"}},
  {{"keyword": "wedding gift", "relevance_category": "Indirect"}},
  {{"keyword": "car accessories", "relevance_category": "NotRelated"}}

You are a senior marketing strategist building a balanced and powerful keyword portfolio for an Amazon product. 
Your goal is to select the {select_count} most valuable keywords from the provided list to maximize both immediate sales and long-term market reach.

Each keyword has a 'relevance_category' ('Direct', 'Related', 'Indirect') and a 'value_score' (representing opportunity).

Think of your selection as a strategic portfolio with three tiers. Your final list of {select_count} should be a strategic mix of these tiers:

1.  **Core Conversion Keywords (approx. {select_count * 0.5}~{select_count * 0.6} slots):**
    *   Select these from the **'Direct'** category. These are your most important keywords for driving immediate sales.
    *   Within this category, choose the ones with the **highest `value_score`**.

2.  **Audience Expansion Keywords (approx. {select_count * 0.2}-{select_count * 0.3} slots):**
    *   Select these from the **'Related'** category. These keywords will help you reach a broader, but still highly relevant, audience.
    *   Prioritize those with the **highest `value_score`**.

3.  **Strategic Discovery Keywords (approx. {select_count * 0.1}-{select_count * 0.2} slots):**
    *   Select these from the **'Indirect'** category. Look for "hidden gems" here – keywords with an **exceptionally high `value_score`** that can bring in valuable, low-competition traffic.

**Your final goal is a balanced portfolio of {select_count} keywords.** Avoid simply filling the list only with 'Direct' keywords. The aim is to ensure both high conversion and wider audience discovery.

Return your response ONLY as a valid JSON array of strings, containing the {select_count} selected keywords. Do not include any other text, explanation, or markdown.

  "keyword 1",
  "keyword 2",
