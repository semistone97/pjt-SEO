# Keyword Prompt
keyword_template = '''
You are given a keyword list related to the product {product_name} to be sold on Amazon.
Each keyword must be classified into one of the following categories:

[Relevance_Category Definitions]

Direct:
- Keywords that explicitly contain the product's core feature or name
- Example: "chicken shredder," "meat shredder"

Related:
- Keywords closely connected to the product category or usage context
- Similarity to product category words (Kitchen gadget, Meat grinder, Food prep)
- Not direct, but **close in category/usage context**
- Example: "kitchen gadget," "meal prep"

Indirect:
- Keywords that are complementary, seasonal, or niche, appealing to similar customers but not describing the core product
- Complementary/seasonal/niche/long-tail keywords
- Keywords for complementary products that appeal to the same customer base despite differing functions
- Example: "cooking gifts," "countertop appliance"

NotRelated:
- Keywords that are irrelevant to the product
- This keyword is not related to the product at all
- Example: "fitness," "travel bag"

[Additional Rules: Move to Leftover]
- If a keyword contains a brand name, move it to Leftover
- If a keyword is an ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number), move it to Leftover  
- If a keyword has 3 or more words (long-tail keyword), move it to Leftover
- These keywords must not remain in Direct, Related, or Indirect categories — always place them in Leftover to avoid consumer confusion

[Listing Elements - Keyword Relevance Category Mapping]

1. Title (Product name / top-level visibility)
- Direct: Must be included (core product nouns, main function, purpose)
- Related: Optionally included (adjectives or feature highlights — keep title length in mind)
- Indirect: Generally excluded (title should focus on core relevance; too broad hurts CTR)
- NotRelated: Exclude entirely
→ Summary: Title = Direct focus, with minimal Related support. Up to 10 keywords maximum.

2. Bullet Points (features & benefits / SEO + readability)
- Direct: Lead with them (start each BP with core keywords to highlight function)
- Related: Actively include (describe features, use cases, benefits)
- Indirect: Limited use (only if they add context or lifestyle scenarios)
- NotRelated: Exclude
→ Summary: Bullet Points = Direct + Related required, Indirect only for context. Requires 5 important direct keywords and associated indirect keywords for each.

3. Description (detailed explanation / SEO + persuasion)
- Direct: Repeat and emphasize (strengthen product relevance)
- Related: Naturally weave in (improves SEO while keeping readability)
- Indirect: Actively leverage (for storytelling, lifestyle context, long-tail search traffic)
- NotRelated: Exclude
→ Summary: Description = Direct repetition + Related integration + Indirect expansion. Primarily uses Related keywords, approximately 20 keywords.

4. Leftover (backend keywords / hidden search terms)
- Direct: If already used in Title/BP/Description, avoid duplication
- Related: Place unused ones here
- Indirect: Good spot for remaining Indirect terms
- NotRelated: Remove (noise reduction)
→ Summary: Leftover = Collect unused Related & Indirect; drop NotRelated. Keywords not used in the above sections.

Generate optimal product title by referring to the requirements, guidelines, and examples below.

[Product title requirements]
Title requirements apply to all product types, except media product types, in all of our worldwide stores. In order to list a product for the first time, your title must meet the below requirements. If your product is already listed and the title doesn't comply with these requirements, the title might be automatically corrected or it might not appear in search results.

Follow these criteria when creating product titles:
• Titles must not exceed 200 characters, including spaces. Refer to Title length criteria exceptions for a list of exceptions to this requirement.
• Titles must not contain promotional phrases, such as "free shipping" or "100% quality guaranteed."
• Titles must not use the following special characters: !, $, ?, _, curly brackets, ^, ¬, ¦. Other special characters, such as ~, #, <, >, and *, are allowed only in specific contexts. For example, you may use these symbols as product identifiers ("Style #4301") or measurements ("<10 lb"). Decorative usage of special characters is not allowed. For example, the title "Paradise Towel Wear Co. Beach Coverup << Size Kids XXS >>" is non-compliant because of the excessive use of symbols around the size.
• Titles must contain the minimum amount of information that can be used to clearly describe the product, such as "Amazon Essentials Dress," "Columbia Hiking Boots," or "Sony Headphones."
• Titles must not contain the same word more than twice. For example, "Baby Boy Outfits Baby Boy fall Winter Clothes Baby Boy Long Sleeve Suspender Outfit Sets" is a non-compliant title.

[Product title guidelines]
Creating high-quality product titles is crucial for driving discoverability and conversions. Customers quickly scan search results, so ensuring that your title captures the most important product information is key to making your listing discoverable. Additionally, overly long or cluttered titles can be difficult to read. Therefore, the ideal title should concisely reflect the key information about the physical product, without excessive detail or non-essential elements.

The following guidelines are best practices that you may want to consider to provide the best possible customer experience:

• Keep titles concise. While 200 characters is the maximum allowed, we recommend that you use 80 or fewer characters because mobile screens truncate long titles.
• Don't include redundant information, unnecessary synonyms, or excessive keywords in the product title.
• Include only the information that will help customers quickly recognize and understand the product. Order the words to reflect the most important product information upfront. You may consider the following order, if applicable:
    - Brand name
    - Flavor/style
    - Product type name
    - Key attribute (that is, the unique selling proposition of the product)
    - Color
    - Size/pack count
    - Model number

[For example]
- Amazon Fresh Decaf Colombia Whole Bean Coffee, Medium Roast, 12 Ounce (Pack of 3)
- Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet, 8" HD Display, 3GB Memory, 32GB RAM, 512GB, Black
- Amazon Essentials Toddler Girls' Short-Sleeve Pique Polo Dress
• For products that have variations, include the size and color variations in the title of the child ASINs and not in the title of the parent ASIN. The detail page displays the title of the parent ASIN, and the title of the child ASIN will only appear once the ASIN is added to the customer's cart. The child ASIN title will not appear on the product detail page.
    Example parent title: Amazon Essentials T-Shirt
    Example child title: Amazon Essentials T-Shirt, White, Medium
• Don't use ALL CAPS.
• Capitalize the first letter of each word, except for prepositions (in, on, over, with), conjunctions (and, or, for), or articles (the, a, an).
• Use numerals: "2" instead of "two".
• Use only standard letters and numbers. Don't use non-language ASCII characters such as Æ, Š, Œ, Ÿ, or Ž.
• Don't use subjective commentary, such as "Hot Item" or "Best seller".
• Titles can include necessary punctuation, like hyphens (-), forward slashes (/), commas (,), ampersands (&), and periods (.).
• Titles can abbreviate measurements, such as "cm", "oz", "in", and "kg".
