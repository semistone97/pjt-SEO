"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2025",Deege,yes,yes,Works great but not as quickly as the videos,"This gadget is really controversial -- people like it or they hate it. I like it. But it IS really over-hyped.Pros*It mostly works. I've had no problem shredding freshly cooked chicken. It does a lousy job at cold chicken and isn't designed for raw meat at all.*It stays where I put it on my granite countertop if I press hard enough to shred the chicken. The one place where it slipped on an uneven surface, I just put it on a silicone trivet.*I haven't had any plastic blades break off (yet) on either of these that I've bought for house and guest apartment. It's too expensive for a kitchen gadget for it to be disposable but it won't work well if a blade breaks off and I'd hate to serve broken plastic.*I don't precut my chicken breast after cooking. I just throw it in the shredder, put the lid on, and give it a few twists to get it started. A thick breast sinks down pretty quickly, after which I go back and forth and round and round. But this where some people get frustrated. I usually have to stop, pull the the unshredded chicken piece out, flip, and place it back in the shredder off-center and shred some more. For me, it's still faster than forks or Bear Paw shredders.Cons*Having to stop to flip the meat. Not the biggest problem but adds a step.*Clean up can be a pain. I scrape as much meat out as I can then rinse the residue into the garbage disposer. I don't lose much chicken but it's not nearly zero like I get with forks or Bear Paws. Then I wash in the dishwasher, top rack only. It's always been OK in the dishwasher. I would not use the shredder without a dishwasher -- too hard to clean.*The biggest complaint I have (and I knew it was coming) is the one a lot of people have: storage. It's as big and thick as a medium skillet and isn't easy to store in a small-ish kitchen. It might be impossible to store in an efficiency kitchen.",4,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3G28397Z9EKTQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8,B0CGRGRXPY,Color: Black,
"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2024",Kristy Bechtold,yes,yes,Shut up and take my money!!,"I have seen these, but I didn?™t want to spend the money on it because I figured it wouldn?™t really work. I HATE to shred chicken by hand. Trying to use two forks to shred it is exhausting and when I use my hand mixer, it flies everywhere. This thing is amazing!! I boiled the chicken and pretty much took it out of the pan and put it in the shredder. It shredded so beautifully it brought a tear to my eye. Lol!!! It also has little grippy feet on the bottom so it stays put while using. Ugh!! I?™m in love! Haha!! Once I was done I rinsed it and put it in the dishwasher. I put it on the top shelf, the instructions didn?™t specify where to put it, but I thought better safe than sorry. Do not think about this, just buy it!!

"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2024",Gosh Darn,yes,yes,It really works,"I love a good kitchen gadget, but I wasn?™t sure how this would compare to hand shredding chicken.  I was so giddy and couldn?™t w say to give this a try.  Let me tell you, this thing really works!  At first I worried that it would be unstable and slide along the countertop, but it?™s got built in non slip rubber grips at the bottom that really did keep it in place.  There are no metal parts, and even the plastic spikes on the inside aren?™t a danger as they are not sharp.  This washes and stores easily.The only down side, as someone mentioned in another review is that you can not shred a large amount at a time.  However, from my perspective;  cutting your chicken into sizes that fit in the shredder, is still MUCH faster than shredding by hand.HANDY * GREAT VALUE * SAFE * TIME SAVER",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXZ6984O6ADWH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8,B0CGRGRXPY,Color: Black,

If you have lots of recipes that require shredded chicken, this tool is for you. It is fast and very effective. This is not a small kitchen tool. It is a size of an average middle sized plate.

"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2024",L Brown,yes,yes,"Very effective, does slide a bit","I was a little skeptical, but it was inexpensive enough to give it a try since I do a LOT of pulled chicken or pork as toppers for the dogs.  Usually about one big pork shoulder or five to six chicken breasts at a time in the slow cooker.  Since it cooks down for about 8 hours it's usually very tender so pulls apart pretty easily. In the past have just used tongs but it's still a little labor intensive.Tried it for the first time on the chicken and it works really well, shredding it down to pretty small pieces.  Obviously the more you do it the smaller the pieces get.One star off because it does tend to slide around somewhat.  Would be nice if the grippers on the bottom  were a little more effective or it had the little suction cups that keep it anchored.  But after experimenting, it slides less if you don't overload it.  Two of the big chicken breasts will fit but it slides a lot.  If you just do one at a time, much less so.If you do anything like this very often (or have the storage space- and it's not too bulky- will stack right on top of our slow cooker), its worth it.",4,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7MP4IO003P9K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8,B0CGRGRXPY,Color: Black,

"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2025",Mary Locke,yes,yes,A Sunday drive and a haircut.,"I was so excited to get this product. It looked so easy and convenient in the video demonstrations. When it arrived, it looked so sleek and colorful, the assembly was simple and quick. I put my cooked chicken in as per the clear instuctions and illustrations. I held the knobs and began to rotate the device, firmly pushing down. ( This is the one instructional flaw, as the instructions imply that you continue in one rotational direction instead of back and forth as in the video and the only way it can go due to the device?™s construction.) To my surprise, the knobs became a ?œsteering??device as I followed it all over my counter. I tried applying more pressure which tired my arms quickly as I ?œdrove??the shredder around my kitchen counter. I tried putting a damp towel under the unit and succeeded in creating several interesting towel origami sculptures but no shredded chicken. Finally, dripping sweat and arms shaking, I opened the device to see if any progress had been achieved. Apparently, I had unwittingly created a new hairstyle for chickens; unruly soft curls on the top and tight structure in the bottom.In the future you can find me at my kitchen counter shredding chicken with two forks or better yet, my 70 year old digit-al equipment.",1,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VE906D8YVJEA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8,B0CYZQ374R,Color: Matcha Green,

"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2024",Elphiesmom,yes,yes,Save your money.,"I?™ve used this a couple of times now and I was hoping I could give it a better review.  The idea behind it is great, but it failed to impress me.I have tried using different size pieces of chicken in order to get it to work better. I have tried different placement of the chicken . Neither seems to help much in getting it to do its job. The meat ends up in piles against the outer edge in pieces that must be pulled apart by hand. I prefer smaller bits of chicken when making chicken salad, it just doesn?™t do it. If you?™re willing to settle for bigger pieces then it might be ok for you.The first time I used it, the unit slid all over the counter surface, but after a run through the dishwasher, it worked better in that it gripped pretty well to the counter surface. The first time, I washed it by hand, no easy task. The brush that comes with it isn?™t really necessary, but I did find the two-tined small fork helpful in getting the chicken away from the shredders. It seems sturdy enough if you understand that the lid is a type of plastic that could break in the long run. The handles are simple to snap in place and they turn freely to help the lid rotate smoothly. Sizewise, it is fine. Any bigger and it would be awkward. Chicken/meat pieces must be on the smaller side to get it to work right, each piece must be broken apart into many smaller pieces. It takes quite awhile to shred chicken by hand and admittedly this is quicker but it still is a process. My daughter says it?™s easier to use a mixer to shred the chicken. I will have to try that, it probably does work better, ?œeasy peasy??according to my daughter. Try the mixer method before spending $20 on this. I wish I had.",2,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D2BEASYMGXN8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8,B0CJN9PG3Y,Color: Red,

"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2025",The Truth,yes,yes,Cheap Cheep!,"Yes, that was a chicken joke....The shredder works, but takes some finagling. The plastic defiantly feels cheap, and the whole time you're using it, you can't help but think it's going to break at any second. There's no grip to whatever surface you're using it on. It has two ""handles"" to turn it back and forth, but you only use one because you end up with your other arm wrapped around the shredder to hold it in place while your other hand struggles to turn it, keeping in mind that it feels like it's all going to break at any moment. And it's that cheap plastic that's going to be sharp when it breaks and I couldn't help picturing this thing shredding me.It didn't break though and after the struggles, the chicken was shredded fairly fast. Just when you thought the nightmare was over, it needs to be cleaned. The ""shredders"" are just long enough to prick you and close enough together to make cleaning it uncomfortable at best.Despite all that, it did shred the chicken nicely, and I'll be keeping it.",3,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21OUPCJRL4H85/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8,B0CGRGRXPY,Color: Black,

Then a couple weeks ago I found this product; I really didn't think it would work as well as advertised, BUT I was so wrong - it works fantastic!  Large chunks or smaller pieces they both get shredded, and the best part is you can stop shredding when you get to your desired size of shreds  Even better - you just rinse it off and put it in the dishwasher.  I love this thing and would give it 10 starts if I could!",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qz2g69B2L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816y5Zu9asL.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2891U77DXBZQB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8,B0CGRGRXPY,Color: Black,

"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2025",Jeremy Edmunds,yes,-,This thing shreds!!,"So far, so good. Its not cheap plastic but its not the thickest heaviest duty either. Some reviews said cleaning is a pain. We clean all dishes by hand anyways and haven't found any difficulty cleaning it. It came with a couple hand tools as-well. We have used bear claws, and we have used forks too. Honestly, if it weren't for this purchase, we would rarely eat shredded chicken because it's such a hassle. We've actually found that by ordering this, we can have more variety in our meals. We have had bbq pulled chicken a couple times, and I told the wife the possibilities are endless now that we can effortlessly make shredded chicken. The blades, arent really blades, theyre just plastic spikes. But they work well. It's about as big as a dog food bowl. Takes up a little space, but stores nicely. Given the plastic cover when shredding, and the rubber lined base, it's very safe. Doesn't slip off the table, and no risk of pinch or cut when twisting the piece as intended.",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S9ZFOJB26XJO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8,B0CGRGRXPY,Color: Black,

Idk how long I was turning but I definitely wasted a good piece of chicken because my son (dog) did not touch his food whatsoever. The blades are safe to touch so you don't have to worry about cutting yourself, but to chicken it cuts like butter. It's easy to put together, just screw the nobs on and get to turning. It's not bulky so it should fit in small places as long as its wide enough.",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EF3F8HT59G7G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8,B0CYZQ374R,Color: Matcha Green,

Then we had a good prep weekend coming up and we decided to do chicken in the rotation and I was feeling a little lazy so I got this on order. Holy crap this thing is fast, now I did cut the breasts in half but put both in at the same time, it chews up 2 thighs at a time all with like 4-5 turns, super solid. Only complaint I have is if you decide to hand wash, the corners of the spikes need to be double checked before you drying rack it, besides that it is amazing.",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VJHFEHJ4IN31/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8,B0CJN9PG3Y,Color: Red,

I was thinking this too but a coworker recommended this so I pulled the trigger and purchased. I HAVE USED 4 TIMES IN THE LAST WEEK AND STILL AM ENTHRALLED BY THE MAGICAL POWERS THIS THING HAS. It's slightly larger then expected (yea I didn't read dimensions) BUT I'm actually glad it is because it easily fits 2-3 average-sized chicken breasts at a time. I also take the handles out after use so it stores nearly flat. It takes me less than 4 SECONDS to have perfectly shredded chicken. I've also used with beef and it works just as good. Cleans easy in the sink and they include a scrubber brush to even help.
